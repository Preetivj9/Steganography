Data Hiding Using Steganography
This project demonstrates image-based steganography, where secret messages are embedded within an image using pixel manipulation. It ensures secure and unnoticed data transmission with passcode protection.

Technologies Used
Language: Python
IDE: Python IDLE
Libraries: OpenCV (cv2), OS, String
Features
✔️ Secure message hiding within images
✔️ Passcode-protected decryption
✔️ Lightweight and fast execution
✔️ No significant file size increase

How It Works
User inputs a secret message and passcode.
Message is embedded in an image at pixel level.
Encrypted image is saved and can be shared.
Only users with the correct passcode can retrieve the message.
Future Scope
🔹 Stronger encryption for added security
🔹 Support for audio/video steganography
🔹 User-friendly GUI implementation
